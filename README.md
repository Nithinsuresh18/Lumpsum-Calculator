# Lumpsum-Calculator
A Lumpsum Investment Calculator helps estimate the future value of a one-time investment based on the expected rate of return and investment duration.

Lumpsum Formula
The future value (A) of a lumpsum investment is calculated using the compound interest formula:

A=P×(1+r)^n
 
Where:

A = Future value of investment
P = Initial investment amount (lumpsum)
r = Monthly rate of return (Annual Rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100)
n = Total months (Years × 12)
